Adding a DateTime extension:

when a user signs up we'll ask for date of birth (no need to ask the age)
we'll extent the DateTime.

* create static class Extensions/DateTimeExtensions.cs and go there 
* use the extension AppUser.cs, go there.

next up: how EF deals with relationships (AppUser <=> Photo Class in our case )
