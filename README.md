Section 9 Introduction:
in this section, we going to implement the components that make up the UI.

learning goals:
1. using typescript types: the best thing that happened to JS (as a dynamically typed language)
2. using the async pipe
3. using bootstrap for styling
4. basic css tricks to enhance the UI
5. using a 3rd party photo gallery

all this so our app will start to look like something functional.
