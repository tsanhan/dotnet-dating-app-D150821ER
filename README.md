summery:
we learned: 
1. store passwords in DB, basic authentication
    * storing password hash is not good enough, there are multiple dictionaries with every common password to hash via different algos (general dictionary attack)
    * lasting keep up safe from that BUT it's not keep us safe from an attack on a single password, only multiple people using the same password
2. using inheritance in C# - DRY
3. using C# debugger
4. DTOs
5. Validation
6. JWTs
7. using services (single responsibility) in C# 
8. extension methods - DRY

next up: login and registration in the FE
