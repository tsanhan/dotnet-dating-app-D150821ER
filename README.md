Adding a photo gallery:
* install and use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kolkov/ngx-gallery
  * can watch the demo
  * can follow the md file to see how to use it

* add the module to members (go to members.module.ts)
* implement in the member-detail.component.ts

* in case there is no photo, we are using a default image
* copy the image file user.png from StudentAssets and past it in the assets folder

so we did it for the member detail component, not the member card component.
* go to member-card.component.html
