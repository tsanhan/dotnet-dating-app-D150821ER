create an AccountController (go to file)
* test it using postman: section 4 (register user) ** pay attention to the differences (via query params/post body) **

* when testing the post with body data, we get 500 error (if you get 404 restart dotnet)... interesting...
* when testing the post with query params, we success

so.. why this is happening? 
next up: well use the debugger to understand.
