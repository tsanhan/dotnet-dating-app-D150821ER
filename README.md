ok so now that we saw different responses in the postman, 
we can see see that in the client side.


create a folder called `errors` and comportment `test-errors` inside it.
this component will test some errors for the global error handling feature we'll have in angular.
go to test-errors.component.ts

run the client app and tent in /errors
