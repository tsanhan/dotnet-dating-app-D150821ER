section 8 intro: expanding our api.
we gonna implement more functionality to our api and understand:
1. Entity Framework Relationships
2. Entity Framework Conventions (using conventions to let EF figure out the relationships)
3. Seeding Data into the Database (the lazy approach)
4. the repository pattern (abstracting our work away from the dbcontext)
5. Using AutoMapper utility to map our models to our DTOs
