section 7 summery:
we learned:
1. implemented global error handling both in the frontend and backend   
    * on the side of the API we just created a class to represent the exception
    * we return this class using a middleware we created
    * we didn't want to rely on the provided developer exception middleware

2. angular interceptors 
3. troubleshoot exceptions ðŸ˜‰
4. create a helper page for the frontend
    * and I encourage you to solve errors you made, and you probably will
    * if you do that you:1. learn a lot in the process 2. get a nice feeling that you can solve errors, 3. this is part of the job

up next: we have all the core stuff we need to start adding feature after feature
so in the next section we are going to start expanding our api
