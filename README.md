Section 11 summary:
1. we looked at the storage options for the photos, and we picked cloudinary as our storage option.
    * no worry the amount of the imaged stored or the logic behind the storage.
2. how to add the phtoso to our user entity collection.
3. We took a look at using a 3rd party API so that we can security send our images via our API and the user authenticate and then we send the image to cloudinary and get the response back.
4. we used the debugger (again)
5. updating and deleting resources
6. what to do (and return) when we create resources in a REST API 
    * we try to stick to the REST based conventions but we'll be pragmatic and try to be flexible.
    * so our API is not RESTful but it's REST based.
