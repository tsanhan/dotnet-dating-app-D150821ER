install bootstrap

what is it?
go to https://getbootstrap.com/ => docs => v4.6

* the css is fine but BS has also have JS functionality
* on the getting-started => javascript page i't says it uses jQuery
* what's the problem with jQuery?
    - angular and jQuery manipulates the DOM
    - angular has CD to on it's own changes - it's wo't work on JQ changes

* so.. we'll use ngx-bootstrap 👍
* go to https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap => get started
* we'll use the cool ng add command (it's updating our project with dependencies, make changed to package.json and angular.json among other things)

* run `ng add ngx-bootstrap` and watch the console 
* look at what we added and where
* what is package.json?
* what is angular.json

add icon package: we'll use font-awesome
* search for font-awesome on npm and install it (run `npm i font-awesome`)

* restart our angular app for changes to take effect.

next up: being able to run our angular app in HTTPS mode -for  windows users
