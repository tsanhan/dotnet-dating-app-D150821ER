Creating a member edit component:

* create a new component named "member-edit" in members
* give this component a route, go to app-routing.module.ts
* add a link to this in nav.component.html  (go to)
* make sure we load the right data, go to member-edit.component.ts 

* test the result

* up next: create the edit form
