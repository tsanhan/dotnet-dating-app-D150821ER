applying a bootstrap theme:
1. go to bootswatch.com and pick a theme
2. install `bootswatch` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootswatch)
3. in angular.json apply the stylesheets AFTER bootstrap's, go to angular.json 
4. restart the angular app

* lets make the top navbar a bit brighter and also display the username, go to nav.component.html
 next up: exporting to a shared module so the app module will be thinner
