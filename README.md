summary:
we've taken a look at persistance when updating resources, went over:
1. angular template forms: and how access the form itself using the @ViewChild decorator
2. the CanDeactivate route guard: to make sure the user want to leave the page
3. adding loading indicators to the app: that shows us a sort of a problem: we making too much api calls...
4. so we stored some data in a service (singleton objects ): 

up next: giving the user the ability to add photos to our application.
