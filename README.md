when we want to start an app where do we start?
what the app actually do?
we start with requirements, we build a social app so... user should be able to:
1. log in
2. register
3. view other users
4. privately message other users

so 'users' have very important role here
- so this is where we start
- we start with our user Entity
but what we should do with the passwords users use to login/register
