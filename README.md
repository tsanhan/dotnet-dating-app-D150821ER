Adding a photo service:
* this service will have the single responsibility to manage the photo uploads/deletion
* when we create a service we first create an interface for it.
* create and go to interfaces/IPhotoService.cs
* create and go to Services/PhotoService.cs

up next: using the service in the users controller.
