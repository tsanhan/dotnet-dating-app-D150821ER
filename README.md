Creating the member interface:
*we need a type for member, we could crete one for ourself... or.. we can search google:
* search for `json to ts` and we can find this site: https://quicktype.io/typescript
* past the object from postman
* copy the results to a newly created interfaces in the model folder
* make sure all the types are fine and we can mode the photo to a separate file.

up next: use these in a service.
