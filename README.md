route guards: 
* what they are? I can access routes by typing them, no matter if I have links or not.
* create folder guards and there create a guard (with canActivate - as in "can we activate this route?")
- go to auth.guard.ts

test this in the browser

this is NOT security. there is not such thing as security on the client side!
next up: create a dummy group route to group all auth guard related routes together
